            <p>Due to the rapid growth of JavaScript, it became evident in 1997 that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed. As a result, Netscape delegated the task of developing a language definition to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), an organization dedicated to computer standardization. ECMA-262 was the name of the ECMA standards, and ECMAScript languages comprised JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

                Between 1997 and 1999, three revisions of ECMA-262 were released, but version 4 was dropped over a decade later due to disagreements over the language's direction and proposed enhancements. Surprisingly, many of these contentious characteristics, such as</p>

EcmaScript was created by Ecma International after Netscape submitted JavaScript for standardization in November 1996. EcmaaScript was also included in the ECMA-262 standard's first edition, which was published in June 1997. Despite their similarities, JavaScript and EcmaScript are not interchangeable.</p>
